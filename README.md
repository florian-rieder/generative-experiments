## Series

### 1. Sinescapes
For this series of p5.js works, I used trigonometric functions, mainly sines, to generate various "sinescapes", in the spirit of Charles Csuri, and many other artists who used such functions to generate organic landscapes.
I also make use of Perlin noise to add touches of organic chaos to my sketches.
